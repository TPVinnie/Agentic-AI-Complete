      "content=\"**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Agentic RAG** are both approaches that enhance language models by incorporating external information retrieval processes. However, they differ in their scope, functionality, and the level of autonomy they grant to the system. Here's a breakdown of the two:\\n\\n### **1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**\\n\\n- **Definition:** RAG is a technique that combines pre-trained language models (like GPT) with a retrieval system. Instead of relying solely on the model's internal knowledge (which is static and limited to its training data), RAG fetches relevant documents or information from external sources in real-time to inform and improve the generation of responses.\\n  \\n- **How It Works:**\\n  1. **Query Formulation:** When a user poses a question or prompt, the system formulates a query based on that input.\\n  2. **Retrieval:** The system searches an external knowledge base, database, or document repository to find relevant information.\\n  3. **Generation:** The retrieved information is then fed into the language model, which generates a response that integrates both its internal knowledge and the newly retrieved data.\\n\\n- **Benefits:**\\n  - **Up-to-Date Information:** Since RAG can access live data sources, it can provide more current and accurate information.\\n  - **Enhanced Accuracy:** By referencing specific documents, the generated responses can be more precise and grounded.\\n  - **Scalability:** It allows models to handle a broader range of topics without needing to store all information internally.\\n\\n### **2. Agentic RAG:**\\n\\n- **Definition:** Agentic RAG extends the RAG framework by embedding it within an autonomous agent architecture. This means the system doesn't just retrieve and generate information passively but can actively make decisions, perform tasks, and interact with its environment based on the retrieved data.\\n\\n- **How It Works:**\\n  1. **Autonomous Decision-Making:** The agent determines when and what to retrieve based on its goals or tasks, rather than merely responding to user prompts.\\n  2. **Task Execution:** Beyond generating text, the agent can perform actions such as querying databases, interacting with APIs, or controlling other software systems.\\n  3. **Dynamic Interaction:** The agent can engage in multi-turn dialogues, adjust its strategies based on feedback, and manage complex workflows by leveraging retrieved information.\\n\\n- **Benefits:**\\n  - **Autonomy:** The agent can operate independently to achieve specific objectives without constant user intervention.\\n  - **Complex Task Handling:** Suitable for applications requiring multi-step reasoning, planning, or integration with other systems (e.g., virtual assistants, automated customer service agents).\\n  - **Interactive Capabilities:** Can engage in more sophisticated interactions, adapting its behavior based on context and retrieved information.\\n\\n### **Key Differences:**\\n\\n1. **Scope of Functionality:**\\n   - **RAG:** Primarily focuses on enhancing response generation by retrieving relevant information.\\n   - **Agentic RAG:** Incorporates retrieval and generation within a broader autonomous framework capable of decision-making and task execution.\\n\\n2. **Autonomy:**\\n   - **RAG:** Typically reactive, responding to inputs as they come.\\n   - **Agentic RAG:** Proactive, capable of initiating actions and managing processes to achieve set goals.\\n\\n3. **Complexity:**\\n   - **RAG:** Simpler integration, suitable for applications like chatbots that need informed responses.\\n   - **Agentic RAG:** More complex, ideal for systems that require persistent state management, multi-step operations, and dynamic interactions.\\n\\n### **Use Cases:**\\n\\n- **RAG:**\\n  - Customer support chatbots providing accurate answers based on knowledge bases.\\n  - Content generation tools that reference recent articles or databases.\\n\\n- **Agentic RAG:**\\n  - Virtual personal assistants that manage schedules, set reminders, and interact with other apps.\\n  - Automated research assistants that gather, analyze, and summarize information from multiple sources to produce reports.\\n\\n### **Conclusion:**\\n\\nWhile both RAG and Agentic RAG leverage external information retrieval to enhance language model capabilities, Agentic RAG goes a step further by embedding this process within an autonomous agent framework. This allows for more sophisticated interactions, decision-making, and task execution, making it suitable for applications that require a higher level of autonomy and complexity.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1406, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 1426, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 512, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'o1-mini-2024-09-12', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-BxKfeVPKdlYRsswMeYVoGBxoFEAay', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--f3edf767-ed4d-466a-bcd2-57e73beb2522-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 1406, 'total_tokens': 1426, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 512}}\n"

      "* **Core Idea:** RAG combines the strengths of traditional language models (like GPT-3) with the factual accuracy of external knowledge bases. \n",
      "* **How it Works:**\n",
      "    1. A user asks a question.\n",

      "    3. It then uses this retrieved information to generate a more accurate and informative response.\n",
      "* **Benefits:**\n",
      "    * **Factual Accuracy:**  RAG models can access real-world data, reducing the risk of generating incorrect or hallucinated information.\n",
      "    * **Comprehensiveness:** They can provide more complete answers by drawing upon a wider range of sources.\n",
      "* **Example:** Imagine asking RAG, \"What is the capital of France?\". RAG would search its knowledge base, retrieve \"Paris\", and confidently answer the question.\n",

      "* **How it Works:**\n",
      "    1. A user asks a question or gives a command.\n",
      "    2. The model searches for relevant information and understands the user's intent.\n",
      "    3. It then takes actions in the real world to fulfill the request or provide a more interactive response.\n",
      "* **Benefits:**\n",
      "    * **Proactiveness:** Agentic RAG models can go beyond simply answering questions and can initiate actions based on the retrieved information.\n",
      "    * **Automation:** They can automate tasks and processes by interacting with external systems and APIs.\n",
      "* **Example:** Imagine saying to an Agentic RAG, \"Book a flight to London next week.\" The model would search for flights, understand your request, and then book the flight for you through an airline API.\n",

We are signatories to the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles and the “UN Standards of Conduct for Business” in tackling discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans and Intersex people.\\nA fundamental tenet of the Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics is ‘Respecting Each Other.’  This articulates our commitment to provide an equal opportunity workplace free of discrimination or harassment.   Our Human Rights Statement provides a broad framework to ensure that all employees are treated with respect and dignity and that a common set of principles apply to our business practices to ensure that we do not condone human rights violations or abuses. Our Supplier Code of Conduct helps us manage and address this important aspect of sustainable business in our supply chains.\\nScope and coverage of Human Rights due diligence process\\nInfosys is committed to provide a safe and positive work environment. In keeping with this philosophy, the organisation has an open- door policy. Training on Infosys values and the Code of Conduct and Ethics, in which our stance is enshrined, is an integral part of our induction program for new employees. In addition, every employee confirms their acceptance of the Code each year.  Employees are also mandated to complete the Smart Awareness Quiz (SAQ) every year which contains learning and assessments on the Code and the human-rights related topics.  Year- round email campaigns on human rights topics serve as a reminder to employees on the expectation of maintaining a respectful workplace for everyone.\\nWe have adopted an integrated Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique business requirements.  Human Rights risks are a part of our ERM framework.   Our enterprise risk management function enables the achievement of the company’s strategic objectives by identifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and governing any risk or potential threat to these objectives.  While this is the key driver, our values, culture, and commitment to stakeholders (employees, customers, investors, regulatory bodies, partners and the community around us) are the foundation of our ERM framework.\\nHuman Rights Risk Assessment Process\\nOur risk assessment process covers our employees, value chain partners and  new business activities.    The organization commissioned a human rights assessment of its India operations in 2022. The findings of the report were used to incorporate appropriate changes to processes and practices.  Human Rights assessments are conducted periodically, as guided by Management.\\nIn fiscal 2023, we launched our Responsible Supply Chain and Supplier Diversity Policy.  The Supplier Code of Conduct was also reviewed and updated. We also launched an exclusive ESG learning portal for our suppliers which includes learning modules on human rights. Our Supplier ESG assessments also cover human rights in our supply chains.\\nRisk Mitigation and Remediation Process\\nBased on the assessment results, at Infosys we have identified areas of strength as well as those that require strengthening and are working towards closing these gaps.\\nMaterial Human Rights Topics for Infosys\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaterial Topics\\nRisks\\nMitigation &
